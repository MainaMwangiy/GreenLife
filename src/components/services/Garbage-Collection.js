              The amount of solid waste produced is growing proportionate to
              the growth in population, which is significantly high in the
              urban areas. With a 4.3% growth in urbanization annually,
              Kenyan Cities and Towns are faced with the ever- growing
              challenge of managing the waste generated by the urban citizens.
              In addition, the advent of devolution has inspired growth of
              secondary towns, which are likely to exacerbate the solid
              waste management situation exposing the urban citizenry to
              wanton suffering. 
              <br/>
              The impacts of solid waste if not properly
              managed within the urban settlements particularly cities
              and big municipalities can be disastrous. But this also
              presents opportunities of turning the waste into a resource!
